This repo is based on the data generated on the [imartinezl/bicing-analysis](https://github.com/imartinezl/bicing-analysis) repo, which estimates bicycle trips based on the state of each station over time. As a first version of the visualization, this project explores the limits of canvas-based libraries, such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [mappa.js](https://mappa.js.org/).

### Built with

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [mappa.js](https://mappa.js.org/)
- [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/)
